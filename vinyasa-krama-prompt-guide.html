    <h2> What is a Prompt? </h2>
    <p> A prompt is a method of communicating with the Vinyasa Krama yoga sequence generator by using written text as input. Its primary function is to instruct the Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to generate yoga sequences based on the given prompt. </p>
    
    <p> <strong>Content instructions:</strong> Guide the AI to understand how to create your yoga sequence by describing the poses and transitions you want to include.</p>
    
    <p> <strong>Themes:</strong> Beginner practices, advanced flows, restorative yoga, power vinyasa, and more.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>Subject:</strong> If you are crafting a specific practice, what poses do you want to see included and/or what is the desired focus (balance, flexibility, strength, etc.).
    <li> <strong>Settings:</strong> Morning practice, evening wind-down, energizing or calming, and other scenarios.
    <li> <strong>Details:</strong> Specific alignment cues, breathwork, or focus points for meditation during the practice.
    </ul>
    
    <p> <strong>Style modifiers:</strong> Define the intensity and pace of the yoga sequences.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>Intensity:</strong> Specify the desired level of physical exertion, such as gentle, moderate, or intense.
    <li> <strong>Pace:</strong> Determine the rhythm of the sequence, including slow-paced, dynamic, or flowy.
    <li> <strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Specify the part of the body the sequence should target, including core, hips, or upper body.
    <li> <strong>Style:</strong> Determine the yoga style, such as Hatha, Ashtanga, or Yin.
    <li> <strong>Effects:</strong> Add specific intentions to the practice, such as grounding, uplifting, or relaxing.
    <li> <strong>Creative Properties:</strong> You can also achieve a desired effect with the name of an existing yoga style or philosophy.
    </ul>
    
    <h2> Crafting the prompt </h2>
    <p> When crafting your prompt, think about what you actually want to achieve. The order of your prompt will affect the outcome; words placed early will generally have a stronger effect. If you use longer prompts, words later in the prompt will generally have a weaker effect. You can often improve your prompts by changing the order of your words or adjusting the words used in your prompt. </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>Medium:</strong> Decide whether you want the sequence to be for a mat-based practice, chair yoga, or aerial yoga, for example.
    <li> <strong>Subject:</strong> Specify what the sequence should be focused on, such as hip-openers, inversions, or sun salutations.
    <li> <strong>Elements:</strong> Identify the specific poses that should be included in the sequence, such as Downward Dog, Warrior II, or Child's Pose.
    <li> <strong>Composition:</strong> Determine the arrangement and flow of the poses in the sequence, including the warm-up, peak, and cool down stages.
    <li> <strong>Emotions/Mood:</strong> Specify the desired emotional or energetic tone for the practice, such as calming, energizing, grounding, or invigorating.
    </ul>
